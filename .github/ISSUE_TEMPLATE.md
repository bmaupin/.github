Hi, thanks for taking the time to create an issue!

I may not be able to resolve every issue that's created. I do, however, typically accept pull requests for most of my projects. If you'd like to submit a pull request, please see here first: https://github.com/bmaupin/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

I will try my best to archive projects where I'm not accepting pull requests.

Cheers!

# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

#### Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind that will help me be able to merge a given pull request:

- ðŸ‘‰ **Please try to limit each pull request to one change.** This makes it much easier for me to review and merge; small pull requests are fine :)
- ðŸ¤“ [Please try not to be too clever!](https://www.simplethread.com/dont-be-clever/) I much prefer simple solutions that are easy to understand over solutions that need comments to explain and use the latest whizbang language features
- If the project has tests, please make sure that they pass
- If the project has tests and you're adding new features, please add new tests to cover them
- Please try to avoid making breaking changes to libraries or APIs; it's generally preferable to add a new method for a new feature rather than modify an existing one
- Please document any newly-added public methods/endpoints
- Please try to match existing code style as best as possible
  - I typically try to use the de-facto code formatters for a particular language, e.g. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), `go fmt`, etc.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) are nice although not a requirement

Cheers!
